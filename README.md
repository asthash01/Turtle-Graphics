# Turtle-Graphics
Created a Clojure project by using LightTable, Leiningen and Quil to implement turtle graphics. It performed the turtle operations moving, turning, and raising/lowering a pen to draw, undo, step run and changing the color of the pen. When running a Turtle program the result of the turtle’s pen is shown in a window. move the turtle in two modes- Run mode and step mode.
